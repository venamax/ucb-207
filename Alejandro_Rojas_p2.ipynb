    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",

    "\n",
    "Logistic regression calculates the likelihood of each class considering the coefficients assigned to each word. There are many words that are simply used in any topic. Longer messages containing more words may lead to wrong conclusions since all words are treated equally. In multinomial Naive Bayes the model makes a distinction based on the number of times a specific word is repeated. This allows the model to make better predictions as certain dominant words are given more weight for certain topics.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the value of C increases so does the value of the sum of squares. C measures the inverse of the regularization strength. As C increases, regularization strength is diminished. As regularization strength is diminished overfitting is more likely and consequently each feature is given a higher coefficient than it actually deserves. \n"

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."
